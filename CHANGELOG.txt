mlgt changes

Ver 0.13

Added alignReport() to report tables and graphics for multiple alignments. Useful to assess if error correction is worthwhile.

Ver 0.12

Added checks for whitespace in paths. Terminates prepareMlgtRun if inputfastafile has whitespace. Could not get formatdb to work with them (even with multiple escapes). 

Replaced user specification of blastallPath, musclePath etc with environment variables BLASTALL_PATH, MUSCLE_PATH etc, which must be set by Sys.setenv. Added checks to prepareMlgtRun that they are set. Original variables still used internally. 

Remove re-use of temp file names. Unique file names allows multiple instances of mlgt() to read/write in same directory. Files could always be deleted after use.

Different sample data.
